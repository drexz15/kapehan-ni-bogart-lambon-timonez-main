            Welcome to Kapehan ni Bogart, a unique coffee house created and managed by a passionate team of students. 
            Our journey began with a shared love for exceptional coffee, delicious food, and creating a welcoming 
            space for people to connect and unwind.

            What sets us apart is our commitment to sustainability and supporting local businesses. We source our
